            <p class="txt">I have been in real estate industry for the past 5 years and am still very much interested in it. Starting in commercial estate, I got to learn about commercial lending and asset management. This is what I would like to do on the side one day when I can take breath. I am currently @ <a class ="link" href="https://www.thegurantors.com" >TheGuarantors</a>. They insure leases so that the landlords are proctected against loss or the tenants can pay a premium on their security deposit rather than putting down large capital to secure the lease. I am really interested in the company but I am so new that I am not sure what my role would be like. But I do hope that I can transition into a dev role within the company since it is a insuretech company.

            <p class="txt">I hope that I can transfer within my company and become a full stack developer or a back end developer. But to be honest, I am not sure what I want in the future. I am hoping I have my weekends back and make more money. One day, I would love to work for apple becuase their interface seems to be much smoother than others and I would like to learn and be a part of that. My personal side goal is to create an automated property management software. As a broker and a landlord rep, there are too many unneccessary softwares and most of them are based on old technology. It is an industry that is slow to change and skepitical by nature but one can hope...</p>
